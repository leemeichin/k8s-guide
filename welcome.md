!!!light V1, hot off the press!
The guide is fresh out of beta and while still in its infancy somewhat, is fully ready for use. It'll take you all the way to running a full-blown Kubernetes cluster with SSL support and automatic domain management.

From then on, it's a simple matter of choosing what to deploy! :rocket:
!!!

Have you worked with Kubernetes but never really know how to manage your own cluster? Have you only experienced it at work, in the cloud? Or maybe you're completely new to it and want to know where to start.

Look no further! This guide will walk you through the steps of spinning up a small-scale Kubernetes cluster that can be used for personal projects, learning, or even small-scale production workloads.
