Have you worked with Kubernetes but never really know how to manage your own cluster? Have you only experienced it at work, in the cloud? Or maybe you're completely new to it and want to know where to start.

Look no further! This guide will walk you through the steps of spinning up a small-scale Kubernetes cluster and setting up some basic infrastructure with it: metrics, a Docker registry, SSL support, and so on.
