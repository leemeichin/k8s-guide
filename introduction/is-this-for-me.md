If you're looking to learn about how to deploy a cluster on the **:icon-cloud: Big Cloud** and to get to know the intricacies of one of those platforms, then I'm afraid it might not be for you.

Even if you just feel like tinkering locally with Minikube, most of this guide will remain applicable with a few exceptions around hosting.
