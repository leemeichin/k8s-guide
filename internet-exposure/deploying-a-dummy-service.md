# Deploying a dummy service

The best way to see the fruits of your labour in action is to deploy a little service that can essentially validate your setup.

In this instance, validation means *being able to access a service on your domain with TLS enabled*.

It's out of scope for this guide to walk through the development of such a service, so a ready-made Docker image is provided for your delectation and all that is required is to, well, deploy it.
